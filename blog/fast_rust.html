            <p>
                As usual, it all started with a showerthought. "What's the <i>fastest</i> sorting algorithm I can come
                up with?".
                Being someone who didn't study software engineering formally, I'm pretty ignorant about data structures
                and algorithms. I've only read one book about it and I have to admit I read it as fast as posible.
                But I'm also someone who spends a lot of time in his head, a day-dreamer if you will. My day dreaming
                specializes in thinking about stuff I don't know jack about. And for that sole reason I've been
                day dreaming about sorting algorithms for quite some months now. So it was only a matter of time
                I would challenge myself like that in the shower. Why not? It would be fun to come up with something
                and then compare it to "real" sorting algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was one more reason behind this challenge. I'm currently learning rust. At the time of writing,
                I'm at chapter 16 of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">rust book</a>. I wanted to establish
                what
                I had learned by doing some crazy project. Plus, coming from python, the whole idea of memory management
                was pretty alien for me. Despite this I found the ownership system pretty intuitive compared with what
                I had to face when I learned C (multiple memory allocation methods and pitfalls). So I also wanted
                to try the whole memory management stuff in a real life problem. And that's when the idea struck me:
                my sorting algorithm will leverage memory (<i>s p a c e</i>) in order to sort faster.
            </p>
            <p>
                Almost all the sorting algorithms I remember sorted using comparisons. I knew there were other methods
                like radix sort but I didn't understand it and the name sounded pretty complex to me. So during that
                shower I came up with the fastest solution I could think of that avoids comparisons:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
// My first attempt at sorting.
pub fn sort_v1(v: Vec<usize>) -> Vec&lt;usize&gt; {
    let sum: usize = v.iter().sum();
    // Create an index vector filled with None with the length of the sum of the values.
    let mut index: Vec&lt;Option &lt;usize&gt;&gt; = vec![None; sum];

    // Iter the input vector and put each number in it's index of the index vector.
    for i in v.iter() {
        index[*i as usize] = Some(*i);
    }
    index
        .iter()
        .filter(|x| x.is_some())  // Filter out None values 
        .map(|x| x.unwrap())      // Extract values from Option
        .collect()
}
            </code>
            </pre>
            <figure>
                <img class="figure-img" src="../static/benchmarks/sort_v1_small_range.svg">
                <figcaption class="figure-cap">First try at sorting benchmark. Note that I could only go up to 100 elements; my
                    algorithm was too slow to benchmark it in a reasonable time.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Well... that looked a lot better in my head. This method is pretty slow. Very slow. Unnecesarily
                slow. Still, it was something and it was mine. My train of thought was "numbers already <i>encode</i>
                where they belong". Therefore if we allocate a vector with sufficient
                size (for some reason I thought I needed the SUM of the values), we'll just have to put each value
                where it belongs and get rid of all of the space in between. Then, by not caring about space complexity
                my algorithm would have better time complexity. This is similar to another algorithm:
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort" class="link1">counting sort</a>, but at the
                time I didn't even remember reading about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                So... regarding what's wrong with this algorithm. Let's fix it. The most obvious fix is to replace the
                <code>.iter().sum()</code> to just <code>.max()</code>. I don't know why I thought I needed the
                sum of the vector, but it's pretty obvious that, if I'm indexing by the values contained in the
                vector, the length of the <code>index</code> vector will be the maximum value in the input vector.
                Second, it seems unnecesary to save the value in the index vector if we already encode the value
                in its index. It makes a more sense to replace the <code>Option</code> with a <code>bool</code>,
                as we only need to encode the presence of a value in a certain index. The result is the following
                function:
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>
// Second attempt at fast sorting
pub fn sort_v2(v: Vec&lt;usize&gt;) -&lt; Vec<usize> {
    let max = v.iter().max().unwrap();

    // Create the index vector with `max` length
    let mut index: Vec&lt;bool&gt; = vec![false; max + 1];

    for i in v.iter() {
        index[*i] = true;
    }

    return index
        .into_iter()
        .enumerate()
        .filter(|(_, x)| *x)  // Filter out false values
        .map(|(i, _)| i)      // Collect index values
        .collect();
}

            </code>
            </pre>
            <figure>
                <img class="figure-img" src="../static/benchmarks/sort_v2_small_range.svg">
                <figcaption class="figure-cap">My second attempt at sorting. Pretty fast for small ranges of values (between 0 and 1.000). Please note that the scale
                is logarithmic in both scales in order to be able to see both small and big differences of speed.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                This version is better and faster. It's faster than all algorithms I benchmarked against it in lists consisting in a small range of values
                and bigger than about 100 elements. But there are two caveats here. First, he complexity of the algorithm is <code>O(n + max)</code>. It
                heavily depends on how big is the max value:
            </p>

                <img class="figure-img" src="../static/benchmarks/sort_v2_med_range.svg">
                <figcaption class="figure-cap">My second attempt at sorting. Sometimes fast for medium ranges of values (between 0 and 1.000.000).</figcaption>

            </figure>
            <p>
                I'm fully aware that "small", "medium", and "large" are kinda subjective here. I'd prefer to benchmark continuosly in both dimensions and plot a heatmap,
                but I haven't had the time to leave my computer running these simulations for so long. Still, the intuition of how this algorithm scales is clear. For
                very large vectors, the only limit is the ammount of ram available.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second and bigger caveat of this algorithm is that it doesn't keep duplicates, it overwrites <code>true</code> one on top of the other in the
                <code>index</code> vector. So let's try to make a "fair" version of this algorithm: 
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>
pub fn sort_v2_fair(v: Vec&lt;usize&gt;) -&gt; Vec&lt;usize&gt; {
    let min: usize = *v.iter().min().unwrap();
    // Use max - min to shift all values to zero
    // hopefully reducing the index length
    let max: usize = v.iter().max().unwrap() - min;
    let mut index: Vec&lt;usize&gt; = vec![0; max + 1];

    // Count how many duplicates are in a given index
    for i in v.iter() {
        index[i - min] += 1;
    }
    return index
        .iter()
        .filter(|x| **x != 0)  // Filter zeroes
        .enumerate()
        .map(|(i, c)| vec![i + min; *c])  // Build vectors of duplicates
        .flatten()
        .collect();
}
            </code>
            </pre>

            </figure>
            <p>
            Now it's fast for sizes larger than 1k in small ranges. In medium and large ranges
            it's only fast for sizes larger than 10 million while ram lasts. It's a lot worse than I
            think it should be but I still have some tricks up my sleve. First, we can check if there's
            a duplicate in order to determine if we can use the unfair version of the algorithm, which we'll
            call "setsort" for now, because the word "unfair" is a bit mean &gt;:( So given the length and
            range of values of a list we can estimate if and how probable it is for it to be a set and then
            get to a probability for which it is acceptable to check for duplicates and use setsort.
            </p>
            <p>
            Second, I'm going to break my rule of only using what I can come up with and peak behind other
            non-comparative sorting algorithms. I'm ready to compare what I can come up with the "real" algos.
            The one that got my attention was counting sort because it is fast and is somewhat similar to what
            I'm doing here. My key takeaway from it is instead of building vectors of repeated values, we just store
            all values in the result array and increment the indexing key we use each time we add a new value.
            Here's some pseudocode of it I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort#The_algorithm">found in wikipedia</a>:
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>
count = array of k+1 zeros
for x in input do
    count[key(x)] += 1

total = 0
for i in 0, 1, ... k do
    count[i], total = total, count[i] + total

output = array of the same length as input
for x in input do
    output[count[key(x)]] = x
    count[key(x)] += 1 

return output
            </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
            Finally the last trick I'll use is using other algorithms depending on the length and range of values
            in a list. This goes against the whole "coming up with it by myself" idea, but at this point I just want
            to go fast. Plus, technically I'm still coming up with these "ideas" and bringing parts of my original
            attempt to the equation. So, given that at the "small" range the fair algorithm is faster from around 1k
            elements, 5 million at the "med" range, and probably 1 billion at the "max" range (discarding radix sort),
            and by fitting a quadratic curve at <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=quadratic+fit+%7B%7B1000%2C+1000%7D%2C+%7B4000000%2C+10000000%7D%2C+%7B10000000%2C+100000000%7D%7D">wolframalpha</a>,
            we get that the equation that determines whether my algorithm will be faster is roughly <code>y = (1.25 * 10‚Åª‚Å∂)x¬≤ - 2.5x + 3500</code>,
            where <code>x</code> is the length of the list and <code>y</code> is the range of values in it. Therefore, for a given list length, if the range
            of the list is more than <code>y</code>, I should use another algorithm.
            </p>
            <p> Which other algorithm? From the plots we can see that in larger
            lists radix is faster and in the smaller ones quickersort is faster (which, from what I read on <a href="https://docs.rs/crate/quickersort/3.0.1">their create</a>
            uses a mixture of insertion sort, dual pivot quicksort and heapsort). So using the same magic fitting method we used with my own
            algorithm we get the following super formula: <code>x = 5000</code>. We need no magic formulas.
            Judging by what the graphs show, the length at which radix starts being faster is always 5000. We'll set that for
            cases in which my sorting algorithm is too slow and lengths lower than 5k elements, we'll use quickersort... for now :)
            And we finally have the fastest algorithm I could come up with! (WIP, # TODO write algorithm)

            So this is finally the fastest sorting algorithm I could come up with. There is still some further work
            I'd like to do, like testing a custom data structure for retrying the idea of reducing space between lists.
            I've already implemented the ability of sorting by a custom function that returns a "SpaceSortable". But as time
            is a finite resource, I prefer to postpone all further work on this until I finish reading the rust book. For now,
            I'll just leave my current ideas in the repo's readme. This is a learning project of mine, so I'd be grateful for any
            suggestion and correction you may have about it. You can open an issue at the repo, hit me up on twitter, or just send
            me an email.
